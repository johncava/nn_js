numeric.dotMM(x,y) - Does matrix multiplication with matrix "x" and "y"

numeric.mul(x,y) - Does scalar multiplication with "x" and "y" regardless if x and/or y are either a scalar (single number) or matrix

numeric.div(x,y) and numeric.add(x,y) used in this case for doing scalar addition and division with a matrix
